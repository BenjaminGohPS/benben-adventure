# Benben's Adventure

- include a description of your game and what it does.

- background info about the game and why you chose it is a nice touch

Welcome to Benben's Adventure. A text-based exploration game reminisce of role-playing games I grew up with. Click on the buttons to explore the locations. Fight monsters with tactics, and knowing when to retreat, is essential. Because living to fight another day is wisdom, not cowardice.

I always like point and click, and the story element of such games. Games such as Monkey Island with it's rich comedic dialoges, and Kingdom of Loathing's simple interface are what kept the imagination running as I read the stories and participated in the exploration aspect of the game.
