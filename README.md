# Benben's Adventure

Welcome to Benben's Adventure. A text-based exploration game reminisce of role-playing games I grew up with. Click on the buttons to explore the locations. Fight monsters with tactics, and knowing when to retreat, is essential. Because living to fight another day is wisdom, not cowardice.

I have always enjoyed point and click elements, and the story in such games. Games such as Monkey Island with it's rich comedic dialoges, and Kingdom of Loathing's simple interface are what kept the imagination running as I read the stories and participated in the exploration aspect of the games. I wanted players to escape into this new world, enjoy the stories, and find ways to overcome the obstacles.
